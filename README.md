#### Project Summary

This was a very important assignment for me during the curriculum because it was the first server-side API call we learned, I used the same API in my first group project and I know what I would like to expand on even after the program is over.  My father loves to know what the weather is locally and abroad and primarily uses an Ipad pro.  One of his complaints as he gets older is that 'buttons' on most user interfaces are too small for him.  I would like to make this application more user friendly for the elderly, the handicapped or for people that find touch screens difficult to navigate.

##### 1. Weather-Dashboard-&-Inputs


###### feature description: a weather dashboard with *form inputs*
- [ ] incomplete
- issues: The first openweathermap API call (with 'latitude' and 'longitude' as its arguments) executes when the user approves a geolocation request.  The second API call (with 'City name') is supposed to execute when the user triggers a form-submit event, however, I can't get the second API call to work.

##### 2. City-Search-with-search-history


###### feature description: when a user searches for a city then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- [ ] incomplete
- issues: See issue 1 above.


##### 3. Displayed-Weather-Data

###### when a user views the current weather conditions for a city then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- [x] complete

##### 4. UVI

###### feature description: when a user views the UV index then they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- [x] complete

##### 5. Five-day-forecast

###### feature description: when a user views the future weather conditions for a city then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- [ ] incomplete
- issues: This feature is partially complete in that it provides the requested info but only when the geolocation request is approved.  See issue 1 above.

##### 6. search-history-w/-links

###### feature description: when a user clicks on a city in the search history then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
- [ ] incomplete
- issues: See issue 1 above.  Also, due to time constraints I could not research how to keep the information in local storage.

##### 7. dash-opens-with-last-search

###### feature description: when a user opens the weather dashboard they are presented with the last searched city forecast
- [ ] incomplete
- issues: See issue 1 above.  Also, due to time constraints I could not research how to keep the information in local storage.
